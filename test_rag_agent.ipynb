      "### Purpose of Research\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new approach for choosing treatments for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, which is a type of bladder cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy. The study will use a method called the COXEN model to help doctors select the most suitable “next therapy” for each patient based on their individual tumor data. \n",
      "\n",
      "The COXEN model analyzes information from tumor biopsies to predict how different FDA-approved cancer drugs might work on a specific patient's cancer. This could provide doctors with valuable information about which treatments are likely to be most effective for each individual patient, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes[[citation:4]].\n",
      "\n",
      "This study is designed as a pilot program, meaning it will help researchers determine whether this new treatment selection method is practical and feasible for broader use in patients. We aim to find out if the COXEN model can provide timely results (within three weeks) to help make informed decisions about patient care[[citation:6]].\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, around 75 different cancer drugs will be considered for treatment. Participants may receive one drug or a combination of drugs based on what the COXEN analysis suggests as the best option. We will monitor how these treatments affect patients, including any side effects, response rates, and overall survival rates[[citation:8]]. \n",
      "\n",
      "This research is important because traditional treatments for advanced bladder cancer often do not improve survival, and there are currently no FDA-approved second-line treatments. By using advanced methods to match patients with the most effective therapies, we hope to improve treatment success rates and quality of life for those affected by this challenging disease[[citation:5]].\n",
      "\n",
      "If you agree to participate in this study, your involvement could help advance our understanding of how to better treat urothelial carcinoma and improve future treatment options for other patients.\n",

      "\n",
      "Your participation in this study will involve a series of assessments and treatments over a specific period. Here is what you can expect regarding the duration of your involvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Screening Phase**: Before starting treatment, you will go through a screening process. This will involve several assessments to determine if you qualify for the study. These evaluations may take place over a period of up to 28 days, during which various health checks will be conducted, including tests on your blood, urine, and imaging scans like CT or MRI [[citation:3]].\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Treatment Phase**: If you qualify and decide to participate, you will receive the study treatment. The exact duration of the treatment will depend on how your body responds to the therapy. Treatment may begin within 3 weeks after you provide a sample for the required tests [[citation:7]]. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Follow-Up Phase**: After treatment starts, you will have follow-up visits to monitor your health and the effectiveness of the therapy. These follow-ups will occur at regular intervals and may include more tests and assessments [[citation:3]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the entire study participation can last several months to a year, depending on your treatment response and the follow-up requirements. Throughout your involvement, the research team will keep you informed and ensure that you understand the next steps at every stage of the process [[citation:8]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Your well-being is our priority, and you can withdraw from the study at any time if you decide it is not right for you. If you have any questions or concerns about your participation duration or any other aspect of the study, please feel free to ask the research team.\n",

      "## Purpose of Research\n",
      "\n",
      "You are invited to participate in a research study about using the COXEN score to choose the best next treatment for patients with metastatic bladder cancer who have not responded to previous treatments. We hope to learn whether this approach can help improve treatment outcomes compared to standard options. You were selected as a potential participant because you have a diagnosis of metastatic bladder cancer and have experienced progression despite prior chemotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This research study is looking for approximately 120 participants with metastatic bladder cancer. Enrollment will occur at sites throughout the United States, and our institute expects to enroll around 30 participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, which means you can refuse or withdraw at any time without any impact on your regular treatment. If you choose to participate, you will undergo a series of assessments, including medical exams and biopsies to collect tissue samples. These procedures will take place over several weeks during the study period, which may last a few months. The potential risks or discomforts related to participation may include pain or discomfort from the biopsies, side effects from any medications given, and the emotional impact of undergoing additional testing related to your illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of taking part in this research may include the possibility of receiving a treatment that could be more effective for your condition. Additionally, your participation will help researchers understand how to better tailor treatments to individual patients, potentially benefiting future patients with bladder cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you decide not to participate, there are other treatment options available to you that do not involve being in this study. Your healthcare provider can discuss alternative therapies that may be a better fit for your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, you may feel a mix of emotions, including hope for a better outcome and anxiety regarding the treatment process. The research focuses on understanding how well the COXEN model works in making treatment decisions, which is based on prior studies and data. While being part of this study does provide opportunities for personalized treatment, it differs from routine care that may not offer the same tailored approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "No direct profit will be made from your samples or data, and you will not receive monetary compensation for your participation. Should you wish to stop participating at any time, you can inform the research team, and they will assist you with the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "By participating in this study, you will help in determining the efficacy and feasibility of using the COXEN model to aid treatment decisions. Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to medical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Duration of Study Involvement\n",
      "\n",
      "The duration of your participation in this research study will involve several phases. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 12 weeks, which includes both active participation and follow-up assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the active participation phase of the study, you will be involved for about 12 weeks. This entails attending a total of five visits, where various assessments and treatments will be conducted. These visits include initial screening, baseline evaluations, and subsequent check-ins at specific intervals (Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12) [citation:3][citation:7].\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there will be a follow-up period that will last until the end of the study. Follow-up assessments will occur after the active treatment phase, where ongoing evaluations will help monitor your health and any potential effects from the treatment received [citation:4].\n",
      "\n",
      "If applicable, there may be a washout period, during which specific treatments or drugs will not be administered, to ensure that the study drug is adequately assessed without interference from other medications. For this study, there are no specified washout periods as participants will start taking the study medication after the baseline assessment [citation:6].\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, please consider the time commitment for these visits and evaluations as part of your decision to participate in this study.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Procedures\n",
      "\n",
      "### Procedures Section of the Informed Consent Form (ICF)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you choose to participate in this study, the Protocol Director and research study staff will explain all procedures that you will need to follow. This section outlines what to expect throughout the study, including screening, treatment, and follow-up procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Description of Procedures:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Screening Procedures:**\n",
      "   Before you can join the study, several evaluations will be done to check your eligibility. These will take place no more than 28 days before you start treatment. The screening will include a medical history check, a physical examination, and some tests. Specifically, you will have:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess heart health, which takes about 10 minutes.\n",
      "   - Vital signs (like blood pressure and heart rate) taken during your visit.\n",
      "   - Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panels, involving drawing about 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of blood. This will be done once.\n",
      "   - A urine test to help assess kidney function.\n",
      "   - A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for cancer (an MRI may be done if you can't tolerate the CT scan).\n",
      "   - If applicable, a urine or serum pregnancy test (for women who can become pregnant) within 48 hours before starting the study medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "   These steps are essential to ensure that you are eligible for participation in the study and to collect baseline health information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Treatment Procedures:**\n",
      "   Once you have been determined to be eligible, you will receive the treatment based on the COXEN score, which helps select the most suitable therapy for your condition. Treatment will be given during the following visits:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Baseline Visit:** This will include the initial drug administration, which may take several hours depending on the specific regimen assigned.\n",
      "   - **Subsequent Visits:**\n",
      "     - **Week 4:** Blood drawn to monitor your response to the treatment.\n",
      "     - **Week 8 and Week 12:** Additional assessments will include taking blood samples and possibly an ECG and MRI, depending on your treatment schedule. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Follow-Up Procedures:**\n",
      "   After completing the treatment portion, you will have follow-up visits to monitor your health and any side effects. At these sessions, physical exams and lab tests will be conducted. The follow-up will be as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Follow-Up Visit (approximately 12 weeks after the last treatment):** This includes a full physical examination and additional assessments as needed. The duration of each visit may range from 1 to 3 hours, depending on the tests performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Invasive Procedures:**\n",
      "   You may undergo several invasive procedures during the study, including:\n",
      "   - A core biopsy of a metastatic site (sampling tissue for analysis) which is usually performed at the beginning of your participation in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Specimen Collection:**\n",
      "   Throughout the study, you will be asked to provide various specimens:\n",
      "   - Blood samples will be routinely drawn, totaling about 6 tablespoons (90 mL) throughout the study duration.\n",
      "   - Urine samples will be collected to monitor kidney function.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Contraception Requirements:**\n",
      "   If you are a woman who can become pregnant, you must agree to use effective contraception methods during the study. This includes options such as birth control pills or barrier methods. If there’s any chance of pregnancy during the study, please inform the research staff immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Additional Information on Genetic Testing:**\n",
      "   In this study, there may be some genetic testing as part of the analysis of your biopsies. This is part of understanding the tumor’s characteristics but will be explained further if you choose to participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any questions about these procedures or anything else concerning the study, please ask the study staff for clarification. Your understanding is important for your informed decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please feel free to ask if you'd like any diagrams or charts to help visualize the procedure timeline, as they can be very useful to understand your schedule throughout the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "The procedures were detailed using simple language and structured in a way to progressively inform potential participants of what to expect throughout their involvement in the study while keeping the right tone and clarity for better understanding. Let me know if you need any further specifics or modifications!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Possible Risks, Discomforts, and Inconveniences\n",
      "\n",
      "In participating in this study, there are several possible risks, discomforts, and inconveniences you should be aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you may experience physical discomfort related to the procedures required by the study. For example, during the blood draw, you might feel pain at the injection site, and there is a chance of bruising or dizziness afterward. If you undergo an MRI, you could face discomfort from lying still for a long time, sensations of claustrophobia, and might be bothered by the loud noises produced by the machine. Additionally, the administration of study drugs could lead to side effects such as allergic reactions, headaches, or nausea [citation:9].\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are taking medications prior to the study and are required to discontinue them, you should know that stopping these medications may lead to potential health risks. Common risks associated with discontinuing medications include worsening of your underlying condition, withdrawal symptoms, or an increase in disease-related effects. It is important to discuss with your doctor any current medications you are taking and what effects might occur if you stop them [citation:3].\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel to and from the study site may also present inconveniences. You may have to make multiple trips, which could mean spending extra time away from home, arranging transportation, and potentially incurring travel expenses. This can be especially burdensome for those who live far from the study location [citation:8].\n",
      "\n",
      "As with any study, there may be unforeseeable risks that have not yet been identified. You should understand that the specific treatment or procedures involved in this study might lead to currently unknown risks. It is important to express any concerns you have so that they can be addressed appropriately by the study team [citation:4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, participators in research studies like this one may be at risk for unintended disclosures of personal information. While we take steps to protect your privacy, it's crucial to be aware that complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed [citation:7].\n",
      "\n",
      "By signing the consent form, you acknowledge that you have been informed of these possibilities, and you agree to participate in the study despite them. If you have any questions about these risks or anything else related to the study, please feel free to ask the study staff.\n",

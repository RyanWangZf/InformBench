Genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results.  Possible risks of knowing results include:  anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination.  A possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment.  These risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease. \n\nSometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.

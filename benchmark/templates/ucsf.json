Replace the placeholders in [] with the appropriate information.\n\nExamples:\n[Example: Phase I study]\nThis study is being done to test a drug called [drug name]. We will test [drug name] with people who have [medical condition]. This drug is experimental. This means that the drug is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of [medical condition mentioned above]. The study team is trying to find out the highest dose of the drug that can be given without causing harm. \n\n[If this is a first-in-human study, add:] This is the first time the drug is being tested in humans. This drug is experimental. This means that the drug is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Until now, the drug has mostly been tested in animals.\n\n[Example: Phase II study]\nThis study is being done to test a drug called [drug name]. We will test [drug name] with people who have [medical condition]. This drug is experimental. This means that the drug is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of [medical condition mentioned above]. The study team is trying to find out if the drug can treat your condition. They will also study any side effects caused by the drug.\n\n[Example: Phase III study]\nThis study is being done to test a drug called [drug name]. We will test [drug name] with people who have [medical condition]. This drug is experimental. This means that the drug is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of [medical condition mentioned above]. The study team is trying to find out if the drug is safe and effective in treating your condition.\n\n[Example: Phase IV study]\nThis study is being done to test a drug called [drug name]. We will test [drug name] with people who have [medical condition]. This drug is experimental. This means that the drug is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of [medical condition mentioned above]. The study team is trying to find out if the drug has any rare or long-term side effects. \n\n[Examples: Social/Behavioral studies]\nThis study will look at how people in the Bay Area act when more free flu vaccines are available.\n\nThis study is being done to learn more about how traumatic brain injury patients can have changes in their hearing, balance, sleep and smell.\n\nThis study is being done to learn about the services that clinicians at different organizations think should be offered within primary care practices. \n\nThis study is being done to compare two kinds of counseling about sleep habits. We want to learn if one counseling method is more helpful at improving sleep. We also want to learn if better sleep helps people feel less depressed.\n\n[Example: Simple Blood Draw study]\nIn this study, the researchers are collecting blood samples to learn more about kidney function after transplant.\n"
